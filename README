These are implementations of sets and dictionaries based on Red-Black
trees.

The dict compatible dictionary implementation supports the full dict
interface and is drop-in compatible with both dict and orddict.

The sets compatible set implementation supports the full sets
interface and is drop-in compatible with both sets and ordsets.

Documentation is included.

As an added bonus there are also compatible dictionary and set
implmentations using Arne Adersson trees in aadict and
aasets. AA-trees are very similar to RB-trees in performance and
structure but the algorithms are much simpler.
